# Production 500 Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the 500 Internal Server Error occurring in production with the news streaming API while preserving the streaming approach.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Environment Variable Validation** - API keys weren't properly validated before processing
2. **Supabase Connection Failures** - Cache server could fail silently if Supabase connection issues occurred
3. **Timeout Issues** - Streaming operations could hang indefinitely, hitting Vercel function limits
4. **Insufficient Error Handling** - Some errors weren't properly caught and logged
5. **Missing Health Checks** - No way to diagnose issues in production

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging

- **Added comprehensive error logging** using a custom `ErrorLogger` class
- **Integrated error logging** throughout the streaming API route
- **Added structured error context** for better debugging

### 2. Environment Variable Validation

- **Added `validateEnv()` function** to check all required API keys before processing
- **Early validation** prevents processing with missing configuration
- **Better error messages** for configuration issues

### 3. Timeout Protection

- **Added `AbortSignal.timeout()`** to all external API calls:
  - NewsAPI: 15 second timeout
  - OpenAI: 20 second timeout
- **Added `maxDuration = 30`** export to increase Vercel function timeout
- **Promise.race() with timeouts** for critical operations

### 4. Robust Cache Handling

- **Graceful cache fallback** - continues without cache if Supabase fails
- **Better error handling** for cache operations
- **Non-blocking cache failures** - doesn't stop the streaming process

### 5. Health Check Endpoint

- **Added GET `/api/news/stream`** for health monitoring
- **Tests all external dependencies**:
  - Environment variables
  - Supabase connection
  - API key configuration
- **Returns detailed status** for debugging production issues

### 6. Enhanced Supabase Client

- **Better connection validation** in `createServerSupabaseClient()`
- **Connection testing** before returning client
- **Improved error handling** for connection failures

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/api/news/stream/route.ts`** - Main streaming API with all fixes
2. **`src/lib/newsapi.ts`** - Added timeout protection to NewsAPI calls
3. **`src/lib/openai.ts`** - Added timeout protection to OpenAI calls
4. **`src/lib/supabase-server.ts`** - Enhanced connection validation
5. **`src/lib/error-logger.ts`** - New error logging utility
6. **`vercel.json`** - Already had appropriate timeout configuration

## How to Test in Production

### 1. Health Check
```bash
GET https://www.infodrft.com/api/news/stream
```
This will return the status of all dependencies.

### 2. Monitor Logs
Check Vercel function logs for detailed error information and structured logging.

### 3. Verify Timeouts
The API now has multiple timeout layers to prevent hanging requests.

## Benefits

- **Maintains streaming approach** - All fixes preserve the real-time streaming functionality
- **Better error visibility** - Comprehensive logging for production debugging
- **Graceful degradation** - Continues working even if some components fail
- **Production ready** - Robust error handling and timeout protection
- **Easy monitoring** - Health check endpoint for quick status verification

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Set up alerts** for 500 errors in your monitoring system
2. **Monitor the health check endpoint** regularly
3. **Watch Vercel function logs** for detailed error information
4. **Track API response times** to identify performance issues

The streaming approach is fully preserved while making the API much more robust for production use.
